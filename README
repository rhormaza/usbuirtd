I've got a usb uirt device (www.usbuirt.com). First, I played with lircd
and see what I could do, however I wanted to use the capability of giving
a pronto code directly to the device. Therefore I started to look how I could
achieve this. Browsing over internet, I found a python class that use the *.so
provided for the manufacturer..So having that, in such a nice programming language
give me the first push to start to write this.

# Project Goals:
 - Have a full daemon, to listen for defined commands either tcp or udp connections.
 - Make the response as fast as possible. It is really annoying when you have a lag 
   here, just image I wanna send a command to my TV and that is achieve with a 500 ms
   of delay
 - Make it multithread as sometimes I would like to send IR signals with delay, for example
   turn my TV on and then after 10 secs change to a predefined input.

# TODO:
 - Write a parser to read from a defined config file
 - Implemented some mechanism of start/stop to send continuos commands. This is very
   useful when you are turning up or down volume, for instance. 
 - Clean the code as it is very messy (not an expert in python)
